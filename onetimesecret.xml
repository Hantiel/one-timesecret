	<en>Secure password sharing integration for GLPI.
Sharing passwords is an IT nightmare, no matter which ITSM tool you are using. Zero-Trust is the way to go, although not always possible and not for all scenarios.
One-Time Secret is an excellent tool to overcome this common issue. By sharing a burnable one-time open link with your interlocutor, you will forget passwords stored in emails or messaging tools forever, available for indiscrete eyes.
Secret Link expiration and additional Passphrase are the icings on the cake.

But opening a website, copy and pasting, sending a messageâ€¦, well, the whole process may be improved.

This is where our One-Time Secret GLPI integration excels.

A streamlined experience for both techs and end-users!rag'n'dropping ticket tasks is the fastesOnt and efficient way to schedule your recurrent tickets, and Reminders. Combine it with GLPI Reminders extension for Chrome and Firefox to reduce your planning time.</en>
